# Exploratory-Project
Implemented a decision-based adaptive algorithm to recover the distortion made by the noise in the image.
Performed image padding and applied a noisy pixels selection algorithm
Utilized fractional integral masks for noisy pixels & fractional differential masks for clean pixels to effectively denoise salt & pepper noise-affected images
Evaluated denoising results, compared with existing techniques using MSE, PSNR, and SSIM parameters
